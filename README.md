The second page is a gallery with pictures from previous meetups. This page is meant to inspire and attract visitors to join the community.

At the bottom of each page, there are also links to social media pages.

### Responsiveness
The website has been tested on several devices, mobiles, tablets and laptops. It responds as expected on all tested screen sizes. The same applies to different browsers such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari. 
### User stories
The website has been created with the User Stories in mind. I consider each goal to be achieved. 

### Manual testing
Manual testing has been conducted on both internal and external links. The internal links take the visitor to the desired section. The external links open a new tab with the requested website.
