The design of the website is divided into three separate pages for easy navigation.

The second page is a gallery with pictures from previous meetups. This page is meant to inspire and attract visitors to join the community. The third page contains a form where visitors can sign up to join the community. All pages have a navigation bar with links to the different sections. At the bottom of each page, there are also links to social media pages.

### Wireframes

### Bugs
One bug that was discovered during the project concerned the navigation bar. At this point, the navigation bar included a link to the section ***Meetup Times***. The link worked fine while the visitor was on the home page, however, if the visitor clicked the link on any of the other pages, it did not work as expected . 

The bug was resolved by removing ***Meetup Times*** from the navigation bar.

### Unfixed bugs
All identified bugs were resolved.
